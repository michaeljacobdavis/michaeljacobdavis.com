                | At Qualcomm, I continued working on the HealthyCircles application moving it towards a

                | warning signs, a workflow for patients to add, remove and manage devies associated with their account.

                | At HealthyCircles, I was charged with increasing the performance and usability of the application.
                | By moving to a clientside Knockout based (<abbr title='Model View ViewModel'>MVVM</abbr>) <attr title='Single Page Application'>SPA</attr>
                | and using ASP.Net Web API as a RESTful backend, we were able to increase performance and decrease the amount
                | of data sent over the wire.

              p
                | Since a large portion of our user base is using older browsers (IE7+), we used Modernizr along with various shims/polyfills
                | to maintain browser compatability.
